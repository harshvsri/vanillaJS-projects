    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Caesar salad is a classic salad made with romaine lettuce, croutons, and
      grated parmesan cheese, dressed with a creamy Caesar dressing. The salad
      is named after its creator, Caesar Cardini, who invented it in the 1920s.
      The dressing is made with ingredients such as egg yolks, garlic, lemon
      juice, Worcestershire sauce, and olive oil, and can be made at home or
      purchased pre-made. Caesar salad is a delicious and refreshing salad that
      can be enjoyed as a side dish or a light meal.
