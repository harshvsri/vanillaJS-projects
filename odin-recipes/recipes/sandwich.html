    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A sandwich is a type of food made by placing one or more fillings, such as
      meats, cheeses, vegetables, spreads, or condiments, between two slices of
      bread. The bread can be any type of bread, such as sliced bread, rolls,
      bagels, or wraps, and can be toasted or not toasted. Sandwiches can be
      served cold or hot and are often eaten as a quick and convenient meal or
      snack. They come in a wide variety of flavors and styles, from simple ham
      and cheese sandwiches to complex multi-layered sandwiches with gourmet
      ingredients. Sandwiches are a popular food all over the world and are
      often customized to suit individual tastes and preferences.
